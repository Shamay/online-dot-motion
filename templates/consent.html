Cohen, M.D., Ph.D.; Matthew Botvinick, M.D., Ph.D.; Leigh Nystrom, Ph.D.; Amitai Shenhav, Ph.D.; Marius Catalin Iordan, Ph.D.; Sebastian Musslick; Wouter Kool; Kevin Miller; Mark Straccia; Jin Hyun Cheong; Abigail Novick; Gecia Bravo Hermsdorff; Gus Baker; Laura Bustamante; Keith Perkins; Candace Rissi-Wise; Natsuko Sato; Cameron Ellis; Markus Spitzer; Seong Jang; Tolulope Adetayo; Chloe Hoeber; Allison Burton; Katie Tam; <span style=" color: #0E1B0C;">Thea Zalabak; Aaron Bornstein</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-align: justify;">The following informed consent is required by Princeton University for any person involved in a University-sponsored research study. This study has been approved by the University&#39;s Institutional Review Panel for Human Subjects.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduction</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You have been asked to perform in a study to learn more about what parts of the brain underlie human cognition and decision-making.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Procedures</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In this experiment, you&#39;ll do something like playing a simple video game - objects will appear on a computer screen and you will be asked to respond to them, based on specific instructions, using either key presses or a joystick. Depending on the specific task, you might get to practice the simple video game beforehand.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the task the position of your eyes and the diameter of your pupil may be recorded using an infrared camera known as a pupillometer. This measurement entails no risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the task you may also have your vocal responses recorded using a microphone. This data may be stored on an outside server with no personal identifiers. This measurement entails no risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In some cases, you may be asked questions about your psychological well-being. These questions may be distressing in some cases. Your answers will be confidential, and you may choose to refrain from answering any questions that make you feel uncomfortable. Additionally, you may be asked to have your height and weight measured. You may opt out of providing this information or having this information exposed to you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Risks and Benefits</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you are engaging in an experiment that involves questions about your psychological well-being, you may experience mental distress based on past experiences. Otherwise, the activities in the study will carry no risk to the participant.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Computer-based and physical experiments only involve operating a desktop computer or handling small objects. The task involved in these experiments requires some mental effort, and you may experience some fatigue during the experiment. However, for those studies, you will receive ample time rest periods and/or stretch breaks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You will not receive any direct benefit from your participating other than the monetary payment or course credit you will receive for participation. You may also draw satisfaction from the knowledge that information generated by this study may help promote better understanding of how the human brain is organized and functions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Confidentiality</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The research team will make every effort to keep all the information you tell us during the study strictly confidential, as required by law. The Institutional Review Panel for Human Subjects (IRP) at Princeton University is responsible for protecting the rights and welfare of research volunteers like you. Any documents you sign, where you can be identified by name will be kept in a locked drawer in an office at the Psychology Department. These documents will be kept confidential.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Additionally, responses about your psychological well-being will be stored in an encrypted manner using an encryption protocol approved by the Princeton University Office of Information Technology (OIT). Only the researchers directly involved with the study in which you will participate will have access to this information via a secure server.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Compensation</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You will be paid $6 for the study. Depending on which group you are assigned to within the experiment, you may receive an additional sum in ‘rewards’ earned during the computer task you will perform. If you decide to withdraw from the study before the study is over, you will still receive your compensation. If you are participating in a lengthy or multi-session experiment, we may offer you a completion bonus at the end of the final session. Similarly, if you are participating in an experiment that involves interacting with social media and are asked to abstain from using it during the period of the study, you may receive an additional monetary bonus at the end of the final session for successfully abstaining.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Further Questions</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="mailto:irb@princeton.edu" class="a" target="_blank">If you have questions about your rights and welfare as a volunteer in the research study, please contact the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects.
